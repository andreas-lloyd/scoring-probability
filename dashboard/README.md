# Scoring dashboard
A basic dashboard that we wanted to make in order to try out some custom scoring functions. 

First we pull in probability that each player has to score, and then we use some function to convert it into a score. The idea is that we graph the distribution of the scores as well as the function itself. We also want to implement a custom function that the user gives.
